make sure output is printed on problem sets
    write "print"
print or head will show how it is sorted

extract patterns you think are interesting
aggregating helps - altair helps

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
```


```{python}
movies_url = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-datasets@1/data/movies.json'
movies = pd.read_json('/Users/sarahmorrison/Downloads/GitHub/ppha30538_fall2024/movies.json')

```
